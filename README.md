# xb

A simple wrapper for the [XBPS Package Manager](https://docs.voidlinux.org/xbps/index.html) used in [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org/), written in Python.

Heavily inspired by [Yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay), my goal with xb was to make basic searching and installing via xbps a bit easier.

Very much a work-in-progress, I'll be updating as I can.

## Installation

Just `chmod +x` and throw it in your PATH somewhere.
